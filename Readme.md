A 3rd-party implementation of Microbot Push service.

This project contains three separate things:
	* a python library to interact with Microbot Push devices via BLE
	* a daemon that handles most of the BLE-related chores (e.g. device discovery/pairing/etc)
	* simple web interface to interact with the daemon
